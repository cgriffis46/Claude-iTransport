// The FreeRTOS half of a network interface, shared by xEthernet and
// xWifi: whatever the chip, and whatever bus it is on, this is how
// user threads reach it.
//
//   user threads                       driver thread (run())
//   ------------                       ---------------------
//   client.connect() ---- inbox ---->  device.connect()
//   client.write()   -> tx stream  ->  device takes bytes, sends
//   client.read()    <- rx stream  <-  device delivers bytes
//        ^ sleeps on the socket's event group until data, room,
//          connect or close — or its timeout
//
// ONE thread, the driver thread, owns the chip driver (iNetDevice) and
// is the only one that touches it. It sleeps on a FreeRTOS queue — the
// inbox — for as long as the driver's poll() says it can, and is woken
// early by anything put there: a request from a user thread, a "data
// waiting" kick from write(), or the chip's interrupt line.
//
// Each socket has:
//   - an rx and a tx stream buffer. Single writer, single reader, so no
//     lock is needed: the driver thread writes rx and reads tx, the
//     socket's owning user thread does the opposite.
//   - an event group the user thread sleeps on. The stream buffers
//     carry the bytes; the event group carries "something changed" —
//     which also covers what a stream buffer can't signal, like the
//     peer closing the connection while a reader is asleep.
//
// Setup:
//
//     xEthernet eth(chip);                   // or xWifi
//     eth.begin(netConfig);                  // before the driver thread starts
//     osThreadNew(netThread, &eth, &attrs);  // netThread calls eth.run()
//     // EXTI callback for the chip's INT pin, if wired:
//     //     eth.interruptFromIsr();
//
// Timeouts are in ms throughout.
