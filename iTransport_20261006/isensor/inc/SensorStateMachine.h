// The part of a non-blocking sensor driver that is the same for every
// sensor: which state it is in and when it got there, the sleep()
// hook, and the two halves of a bus operation.
//
//   template <typename TTransport>
//   class bmp280 : public SensorStateMachine<TTransport, bmp280_state_t> { ... };
//
// TTransport is the bus the driver talks through, and this class
// inherits from it, so the driver does too. TState is the driver's
// own state enum; the states themselves, and the switch in main()
// that walks them, stay in the driver.
//
// A driver built on this never waits on the bus. Each bus operation
// is two states:
//
//   case xxx_read_id:                       // issue it
//       issued(this->readRegs(reg, &id, 1), xxx_wait_id, nowMs);
//       break;
//   case xxx_wait_id:                       // wait for it to land
//       if (landed(nowMs)) { ...use id...; enter(xxx_next, nowMs); }
//       break;
//
// issued() and landed() carry the timeout and the failure path, so a
// state cannot wait for ever: anything that goes wrong ends in the
// driver's error state, and errorCleared() there says when it is safe
// to start again.
//
// Works with any transport that has isBusy() and lastOpFailed() —
// ISensorTransport (I2C, SPI) and iTransportOneWire alike. Which of
// those a particular driver needs is for the driver to assert.
//
// A driver on a stream transport (iTransport: a sensor that just
// keeps sending, like the PM2.5) has no bus operations to issue or
// wait for, and uses only the state, timing and sleep() parts.
// issued(), landed(), finished() and errorCleared() are compiled only
// where a driver calls them, so the transport need not have isBusy().
//
// Not to be confused with SensorBase, the older base class in this
// folder. SensorBase holds a reference to an ISensorTransport and
// runs one fixed sequence of states that a sensor customises through
// virtual functions. Here the transport is inherited rather than
// referenced, it need not be an ISensorTransport, and every driver
// keeps its own states.
