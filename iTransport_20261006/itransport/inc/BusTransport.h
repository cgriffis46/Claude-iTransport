// Everything an interrupt-driven bus transport needs that is the same
// whatever the bus: arbitration, the transfer-completion signal, and
// the busy/failed bookkeeping. I2CTransport, SPITransport and
// OneWireUartTransport all derive from this, alongside the interface
// they present to a driver (ISensorTransport or iTransportOneWire),
// and add only what is particular to their bus.
//
// Deliberately NOT derived from any driver-facing interface itself:
// the machinery here is the same for a register bus and for 1-Wire,
// whose interfaces differ. Each bus class forwards its interface's
// isBusy()/lastOpFailed() to the two functions of the same name here.
//
// The life of one transfer:
//
//   1. beginTransfer()   takes the bus (the mutex, where there is one)
//                        and registers this instance as the one the
//                        bus interrupt should signal.
//   2. the hardware call starts the transfer and returns at once.
//      endIssue() gives the bus straight back if it didn't start.
//   3. onTransferComplete(), called from the bus interrupt, finds the
//      registered instance and calls its SignalTransferComplete().
//   4. isBusy(), called by whoever is waiting, sees the signal via
//      WaitForTransfer(), calls onTransferLanded(), and releases the bus.
//
// No RTOS header is included here. ObtainMutex()/ReleaseMutex() and
// SignalTransferComplete()/WaitForTransfer() are where a platform's
// own primitives go — see FreeRtosTransport<TBus>, which supplies the
// CMSIS-RTOS2 versions for I2C and SPI alike. The defaults below are a
// working, if less efficient, fallback for a target with no RTOS: a
// flag set by the interrupt and polled by isBusy().
//
// Bus handles are opaque (void*) for the reason given in I2CTransport.h:
// STM32Cube HAL handle types can't safely be forward-declared.
