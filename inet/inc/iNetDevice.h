// The seam between a network chip's driver and the interface built
// on it (xEthernet, xWifi). Nothing above this knows which chip it
// is, or what bus the chip is on:
//
//   W5500 over SPI          -> iBlockTransport  (inet/w5500)
//   ESP-AT Wi-Fi over UART  -> iTransport        (stream)
//   ATWINC1500 over SPI     -> iBlockTransport
//   a PHY on MII/RMII       -> the MCU's own Ethernet MAC + a host
//                              TCP/IP stack (lwIP) behind this same
//                              interface. Not on the STM32L432,
//                              which has no Ethernet MAC.
//
// These are socket-offload devices: the chip (or the stack behind the
// driver) does TCP, and this interface deals in sockets and bytes.
//
// Threading: every call in iNetDevice, and every callback into
// iNetDeviceHost, happens on ONE thread — the interface's driver
// thread. A device driver needs no locks of its own; the host's
// callbacks are where data crosses to user threads.
//
// Non-blocking, like the sensor drivers: poll() advances the driver's
// state machine as far as it can without waiting, and says how long
// it can be left before it needs calling again.
